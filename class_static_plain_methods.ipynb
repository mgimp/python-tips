    "\n",
    "1. Eliminates the use of the `self` argument.\n",
    "2. Reduces memory usage becayse Python doesn't have to instantiate a bound-method for each object instantiated (don't have to recreate the method for each new object).\n",
    "3. Improves code readability, signifying that the method does not depend on the state of the object itself.\n",
    "4. Allows for method overriding in that if the method were defined at the module-level (outside the class), a subclass would not be able to override that method."
